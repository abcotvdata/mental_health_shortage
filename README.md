Headline: Nearly 2,000 counties have fewer than 50 mental health care providers per 100,000 residents, including more than 75% of rural counties.

Some key findings:

-- There are more than 1,600 counties with fewer than 10 mental health professionals.

-- There are 769 counties where there are fewer than 10 providers per 100,000 residents.

-- There are more than 1,900 counties where the ratio is less than 50 providers per 100,000 residents – a ratio that would mean one provider for every 2,000 potential patients.

-- Texas has the most counties with fewer than 10 total providers. That’s true in 172 counties.

-- Texas is also among the worst states in the country for the share of counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100,000 residents (82% of counties). Only Iowa (86%), Mississippi (85%), Alabama (84%) and Louisiana (83%) had a larger share of counties with low access to care.

A table of the numbers/ratios of providers for every county is here, entitled: providers_by_county_table.

Methodology: To arrive at this data, we analyzed the most recent list of providers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ National Plan and Provider Enumeration System -- all those who had a provider number are either required by HIPAA (psychiatrists and psychologists) or asked for one. Therefore, while the data may undercount a small number of providers, it is a reliable estimate.

We filtered the data for select mental health professions, then calculated the number of providers per 100K people in each county across the US and the provider to patient ratio. For the states we cover, the number of counties with low access to mental health providers:

California: 2 counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100k residents
Delaware: 0 counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100k residents
Illinois: 57 counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100k residents
Indiana: 70 counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100k residents
New Jersey: 5 counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100k residents
New York: 22 counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100k residents
North Carolina: 31 counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100k residents
Pennsylvania: 25 counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100k residents
Texas: 208 counties with fewer than 50 providers per 100k residents
