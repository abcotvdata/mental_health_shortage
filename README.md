Some key findings from the analysis: 
-- Rural counties tend to have fewer providers per capita, while urban counties tend to have more.
-- The majority of counties with no providers or few providers per capita are in the Midwest and Southeast
-- Texas has the highest number of counties with 0 providers. Nebraska has the highest percentage of counties with no providers (49.5%).
-- Mississippi has the highest percentage of counties with fewer than 50 providers per capita (85.4%), followed by Iowa (85%).

Methodology: To arrive at this data, we analyzed the most recent list of providers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesâ€™ National Plan and Provider Enumeration System -- all those who had a provider number are either required by HIPAA (psychiatrists and psychologists) or asked for one. Therefore, while the data may be an undercount, it is a reliable estimate.

We filtered the data for mental health professions, then calculated the number of providers per 100k people in each county across the US and the provider to patient ratio.
