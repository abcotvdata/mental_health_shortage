You can see the county by county figures displayed on an interactive county map here: https://abcotvdata.github.io/mental_health_shortage/providers_by_county.html
(The map is currently for reporting purposes, but we'll refine for use as an interactive embed in web stories.)

A table of the numbers/ratios of providers for every county is here, entitled: providers_by_county_table.

Methodology: To arrive at this data, we analyzed the most recent list of providers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesâ€™ National Plan and Provider Enumeration System -- all those who had a provider number are either required by HIPAA (psychiatrists and psychologists) or asked for one. Therefore, while the data may be an undercount, it is a reliable estimate.

We filtered the data for mental health professions, then calculated the number of providers per 100K people in each county across the US and the provider to patient ratio.
